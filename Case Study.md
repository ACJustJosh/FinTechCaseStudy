Randy founded this lending agency in the United States in the early 2000's but failed to create the proper platform that was needed.  One day, he met Tate hackert, a college student who was intrigued with Randy's business model.  Randy passed the idea on to Tate, who launched Zayzoon in the Canadian market on July 30th, 2014.

## Landscape:

* Zayzoon is a part of the lending sector of finance technologies.

* Over the past 5-10 years, the lending fintech domain has experienced significant growth and innovation. Here are some of the major trends and innovations that have emerged during this time:

Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as Lending Club and Prosper, have gained popularity as an alternative to traditional banks. These platforms connect borrowers with investors and offer lower interest rates than traditional lenders.

Online Marketplaces for Small Business Loans: Online marketplaces, such as Funding Circle and Kabbage, have emerged to offer small businesses an alternative to traditional bank loans. These platforms offer faster loan approvals and funding, as well as more flexible loan terms.

Alternative Credit Scoring Models: Fintech companies are leveraging alternative data sources, such as social media and mobile phone usage, to evaluate creditworthiness and offer loans to individuals who may not have a traditional credit history.

Blockchain-based Lending: Some fintech companies are exploring the use of blockchain technology to facilitate lending. This can potentially reduce transaction costs and increase transparency in the lending process.

On-Demand Wage Access: Fintech companies, such as ZayZoon and Even, are offering employees access to earned wages before payday to help them avoid costly payday loans.

AI and Machine Learning: Fintech companies are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze large amounts of data and make more accurate lending decisions. This can help to reduce the risk of default and improve overall loan performance.

Overall, the lending fintech domain has seen significant innovation over the past 5-10 years, with new platforms and technologies emerging to disrupt traditional lending models and provide more accessible and affordable financing options to consumers and businesses


* Borrowell, Clearbanc, Fundthrough, Instant, Lendified, Lending Loop, Paybright, and Progressa are other major companies within the lending sector of finance technologies

## Results

* Zayzoon has had a positive impact on businesses by improving employee financial wellness, which can lead to increased productivity, reduced absenteeism, and lower turnover rates. When employees have access to earned wages before payday, they are better able to manage their finances and avoid costly payday loans or other forms of high-interest borrowing. Zayzoon's financial wellness resources, such as financial coaching and educational materials, can also help employees improve their financial literacy and make better financial decisions.

Employers who offer Zayzoon's services to their employees have reported seeing improvements in employee morale and engagement, as well as a decrease in the financial stress that can lead to absenteeism and turnover. Zayzoon's platform is also easy to implement and integrate with existing payroll systems, making it a convenient option for businesses looking to improve the financial wellness of their workforce.


* Companies in the fintech lending domain use a variety of metrics to measure success, including:

Loan Origination Volume: The total amount of loans originated by a lender is a key metric for measuring success. A high loan origination volume indicates strong demand for the lender's loan products.

Default Rates: The percentage of loans that default is a key metric for measuring credit risk and loan quality. Lower default rates indicate that the lender is effectively evaluating credit risk and managing their loan portfolio.

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): CAC measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, including marketing, sales, and other expenses. Lower CAC indicates a more efficient customer acquisition strategy.

Customer Retention: The percentage of customers who return to the lender for additional loans is a key metric for measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Net Promoter Score (NPS): NPS measures customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers how likely they are to recommend the lender's loan products to others.
.  

* It is difficult to make a direct comparison of Zayzoon's performance to its competitors, as the company operates in a unique niche of the "payroll lending" space. Zayzoon has received positive feedback from both employers and employees for its employee financial wellness programs. By teaching financial education and responsible borrowing, Zayzoon aims to help employees improve their overall financial health, which can lead to increased productivity and employee morale.

Zayzoon is a relatively small player in the payroll lending space, but the company has been expanding its reach by partnering with more employers and integrating with additional payroll systems. Zayzoon has also received funding from venture capital firms, indicating that there is interest in the company's unique approach to financial wellness.

Overall, while Zayzoon may not have the same level of market dominance as some of its competitors, the company's focus on financial education and employee wellbeing is a unique selling point that has resonated with many employers and employees


## Recommendations

* To gain a larger position in the lending domain of FinTech, Zayzoon could make efforts to reduce or eliminate the $5 flat fee, which is charged to employees to access accumulated wages.  While still keeping company profitablity in mind, Zayzoon could transition towards a monthly, subscription-based fee for employees to access accumulated wages.   

* Eliminating or reducing the $5 flat fee for accessing earned wages could help Zayzoon be more competitive in the "payroll lending' domain because there are other companies such as "EarnIN" which already charge $0 for access to earned wages.  Management could also analyze Zayzoon operation data, and determine if transitioning to monthly subscription-based payments could potentially benefit the company in terms of profitability.  

* This remodeled payment model would require a strategic plan for marketing and implementation.  Team collaboration applications could be used to aid in the development of the new payment model, and could also aid with implementation and marketing.

* Collaborative applications such as google docs, slack, and drop box could be very useful for re-developing, marketing and implementing a revised payment model.  These applications can allow teams to communicate ideas and collaborate on different aspects of the project.
